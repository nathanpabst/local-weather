# Local Weather Project

## Description
This application is used to help users find the weather. When the user registers or signs into the page, they see a search bar which accepts a 5 digit zip code, an option to view their favorite cities, and an option to logout of the app. The user can interact with the app in the following ways:
- Using the search bar. On keypress, the weather for the given city will appear.
- Viewing the forecast for the next five days.
- Adding the location to their favorites section.
Within the favorites section, they can interact with the app by...
- deleting the city from their favorites list
- marking the weather as scary
- logging out of the application

Concepts covered: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, jQuery, JavaScript/ES6, JSON, AJAX, Node.JS/Grunt/Browserify, DOM manipulation, CRUD, authentication, databases, and Firebase deployment.
